# Ben Mazzarol

Hi there! I'm Ben, a software engineer with a passion for building small 
libraries and tools that solve problems that I have run into.

I hope you find something useful in my repositories! Feel free to reach out
if you have any questions or feedback.

## Monorepo

This repository acts as a monorepo for all of my projects. Each project is
a git submodule that can be found in the `projects/` directory.

This allows me to manage all of my projects in one place, while still keeping
them separate and independent. It makes updating dependencies and other
chores much easier for me.

It also allows me to enforce a degree of consistency across all of my projects,
such as using the same linters, formatters and CI/CD pipelines.

Contributing is still expected to be done on a per-project basis, using the well
known GitHub workflow.
